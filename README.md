## web scraper

i made a web scraper you can change the url and what you are looking for 
built using:

- axios - literally just returns all the html from a url which is pretty swag
- cheerio - lets you find specific things within the html
- express - its like a backend server type thing

## example:

> i used the f1 website and told it to return the text
> from all the classes called " f1--s "
> its cool i guess
