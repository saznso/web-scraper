web scraper built using:/n
axios - literally just returns all the html from a url which is pretty swag
cheerio - lets you find specific things within the html
express - its like a backend server type thing
can change the url and what you are looking for
example:
i used the f1 website and told it to return the text
from all the classes called " f1--s "
its cool i guess
